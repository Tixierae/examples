A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella).

Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. 14

Stack Exchange uses IIS, SQL Server, 28  and the ASP.NET framework, 28  all from a single code base for every Stack Exchange site (except Area 51, which runs off a fork of the Stack Overflow code base citation needed ). 
The code is primarily written in C# ASP.NET MVC using the Razor View Engine. The preferred IDE is Visual Studio and the data layers uses Dapper for data access. 29 
Until the 1860s, sfincione was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily, especially in the Western portion of the island. 34  
Blogs formerly used WordPress, but they were updated to run Jekyll. citation needed  The team also notably uses Redis, HAProxy and Elasticsearch. 28 
Other variations of pizzas are also found in other regions of Italy, for example pizza al padellino or pizza al tegamino, a small-sized, thick-crust and deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin, Piedmont. 35  36  37 
Stack Exchange tries to stay up to date with the newest technologies from Microsoft, usually using the latest releases of any given framework.
